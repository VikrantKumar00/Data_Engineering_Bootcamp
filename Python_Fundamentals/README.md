# Week 1 - Python Fundamentals

## Day 1: Introduction to Programming Concepts & Flowcharts

Today, I learned about:
- What programming is (giving instructions to computers).
- Algorithms (step-by-step solutions).
- Flowcharts (visualizing algorithms using symbols like Oval for start/end, Rectangle for process, Diamond for decision, Parallelogram for input/output).

**Conceptual Exercise 1.1.1 Notes:**
* My flowchart for "making a cup of coffee" included steps like: START -> Boil Water -> Add Coffee -> Add Sugar (decision if needed) -> Stir -> END.
